# coffee-sloth-ios transformed into Baby Jesus Flying with Magnets

A mobile version of the Coffee Sloth developed using Swift. The original game was a browser game developed using PixiJS (see www.tinyurl.com/coffeesloth).

This open source game developed by one of our team members was transformed into our submission to Junction 2016 hackathon. In this game you fly a baby jesus, avoid devils and rain terror from the skies. It is controlled with toys that have magnets embedded in them.
